              This is my second time working in HTML/CSS since i graduate from school.
              It has been a learning experience since I forgot everything I learned in class.
              However, I have enjoyed this course and the knowledge I have regainned has been fun obtaining.

                  I would like to express my deep appreciation to all the instructors and staff at Udacity.
                  This course has been a great lead into the programming world.
                  I hope to contiue with FrontEnd coding within the coming months.

                  Allow me to introduce you to the "Unstable Mates Mustang Club".
                  The club was started in 2008 by two(2) car enthusist, Lebaron Grove and Anthony Rivers.
                  I officially joined the club in 2012 and became member 108.
                  After 5(five) years of membership I gain the status of club Godfather.
                  If you love cars, especially mustangs and are in the surrounding Atlanta GA area look for us at a show.
